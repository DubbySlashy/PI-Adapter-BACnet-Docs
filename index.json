    "keywords": "OSIsoft Adapter for BACnet data selection configuration In addition to the data source configuration, you need to provide a data selection configuration to specify the data you want the BACnet adapter to collect from the data sources. When you add a data source, the BACnet adapter will discover devices and objects specified in the configuration. BACnet device configuration During data source discovery, device information for all discovered devices is retrieved by the adapter, which is subsequently available through the following REST endpoint using any configuration tool that can execute an HTTP GET command: http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/<adapterId>/DeviceConfiguration/ . Note: The device configuration is generated by the adapter and only supports HTTP GET and DELETE. The device configuration may be used to choose an appropriate DataCollectionMode when configuring data selection. The following is an example of BACnet device configuration that contains one routed device: [ { \"DeviceIP\": \"10.12.8.64\", \"DeviceId\": 419, \"NetworkNumber\": 20, \"MacAddress\": \"ba:cb:00:5a:c4:16\", \"MaxApduSupported\": 480, \"SegmentationSupported\": \"MaxSegmentation\", \"ServicesSupported\": [ \"WhoIs\", \"IAm\", \"ReadProperty\", \"ReadPropertyMultiple\" ] } ] Configure BACnet data selection Note: You cannot modify BACnet data selection configurations manually. You must use the REST endpoints to add or edit the configuration. Complete the following to configure the BACnet data selection: Using any text editor, create a file that contains an BACnet data selection in JSON form. For content structure, see BACnet data selection example . For a table of all available parameters, see BACnet data selection . Save the file, for example as DataSelection.config.json . Use any of the Configuration tools capable of making HTTP requests to execute a POST command with the contents of that file to the following endpoint: http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/<adapterId>/DataSelection/ Example using curl (run this command from the same directory where the file is located): Note: During installation, you can add a single BACnet adapter named BACnet1. The following example uses this component name. curl -v -d \"@DataSelection.config.json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \"http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/BACnet1/DataSelection\" BACnet data selection schema The full schema definition for the BACnet data selection configuration is in the BACnet_DataSelection_schema.json here: Windows: %Program Files%\\OSIsoft\\Adapters\\BACnet\\Schemas Linux: /opt/OSIsoft/Adapters/BACnet/Schemas BACnet data selection parameters The following parameters can be used to configure BACnet data selection: Parameter Required Type Description Selected Optional boolean Use this field to select or clear a measurement. To select an item, set to true. To remove an item, leave the field empty or set to false. If not configured, the default value is false. Name Optional string The optional friendly name of the data item collected from the data source. If not configured, the default value will be the stream id. StreamID Optional string The custom stream ID used to create the streams. If not specified, the BACnet adapter will generate a default stream ID based on the measurement configuration. A properly configured custom stream ID follows these rules: Is not case-sensitive. Can contain spaces. Cannot start with two underscores (\"__\"). Can contain a maximum of 100 characters. Cannot use the following characters: / : ? # [ ] @ ! $ & ' ( ) \\ * + , ; = % < > | Cannot start or end with a period. Cannot contain consecutive periods. Cannot consist of only periods. DataFilterId Optional string The ID of the data filter. If not specified, no data filtering will occur. DeviceIPAddress Required string Device IP Address ObjectType Required string Any of the supported object types ObjectId Required number BACnet object instance number DataCollectionMode Optional string Specifies the mode of data collection for the item. Default and only available value is Poll. DataCollectionInterval Optional number Specifies the interval (in seconds) at which data is collected for the item. Default value is 300. PropertyIdentifier Optional string Specifies which property to collect from the BACnet object. If left empty, PresentValue is collected. BACnet data selection example The following is an example of valid BACnet data selection configuration. Since the second item has selected set to false, data will not be collected for it. [ { \"Selected\": true, \"Name\": \"10.12.112.40_14.AnalogInput90\", \"StreamId\": \"10.12.112.40_14.AnalogInput90\", \"DeviceIPAddress\": \"10.12.112.40\", \"DeviceId\": 14, \"ObjectType\": \"AnalogInput\", \"ObjectId\": 90, \"DataCollectionMode\": \"Poll\", \"DataCollectionInterval\": 300 }, { \"Selected\": false, \"Name\": \"10.12.112.40_16.AnalogOutput70\", \"StreamId\": \"10.12.112.40_16.AnalogOutput70\", \"DeviceIPAddress\": \"10.12.112.40\", \"DeviceId\": 16, \"ObjectType\": \"AnalogOutput\", \"ObjectId\": 70, \"DataCollectionMode\": \"Poll\", \"DataCollectionInterval\": 200, \"PropertyIdentifier\": \"PresentValue\" } ]"

Configure BACnet data source Note: You cannot modify BACnet data source configurations manually. You must use the REST endpoints to add or edit the configuration. Complete the following procedure to configure the BACnet data source: Using any text editor, create a file that contains a BACnet data source in JSON form. For content structure, see BACnet router data source example . For a table of all available parameters, see BACnet data source parameters . Save the file, for example as DataSource.config.json . Use any of the Configuration tools capable of making HTTP requests to execute a POST command with the contents of that file to the following endpoint: http://localhost:<Port>/api/v1/configuration/<adapterId>/DataSource/ . Note: The following example uses BACnet1 as the adapter component name. For more information on how to add a component, see System components configuration. 5590 is the default port number. If you selected a different port number, replace it with that value. curl -v -d \"@DataSource.config.json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \"http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/BACnet1/DataSource\" Note: After you have completed data source configuration, the next step is to configure data selection. For more information, See OSIsoft Adapter for BACnet data selection configuration . BACnet data source schema The full schema definition for the BACnet data source configuration is in the BACnet_DataSource_schema.json here: Windows: %Program Files%\\OSIsoft\\Adapters\\BACnet\\Schemas Linux: /opt/OSIsoft/Adapters/BACnet/Schemas BACnet data source parameters The following parameters can be used to configure an BACnet data source: Parameter Required Type Description IPAddress Required string IPv4 address of BACnet device or BACnet router Port Optional number UDP port number for communication with BACnet devices. The value ranges from 0 to 65535. If not configured, the default port is 47808 (which is the default port for BACnet protocol). MaxConcurrentNetworkRequests Optional number The maximum number of requests that can be sent concurrently on the network. This is not affected by the response time for the requests. A value of 0 indicates no limit. The default is 1. DeviceRequestDelay Optional number The delay in milliseconds between sending each request to an individual device. The value ranges from 0 to 10000 milliseconds. The default is 0 ms. AllowedConsecutiveFailedRequests Optional number The number of consecutive failed requests to a device before waiting DeviceReconnectInterval to try sending requests again. The value ranges from 3 to 1000. The default is 3. DeviceReconnectInterval Optional number The amount of time in minutes to wait before attempting to send requests to a device after it has disconnected. The value must be greater than 0. The default is 60 minutes. DeviceId Optional number Device instance number. If specified, the IPAddress will be interpreted as for a BACnet device (not a BACnet router). If empty, the IPAddress will be interpreted as for a BACnet router (not an individual BACnet device). NetworkNumber Optional number Device network number for routed BACnet devices. This setting can only be specified when a DeviceId is specified. When this setting is specified, MACAddress must also be specified MacAddress Optional string Device MAC address for routed BACnet devices. This setting can only be specified when a DeviceId is specified. When this setting is specified, NetworkNumber must also be specified. It must contain 1-6 byte strings in hexadecimal format, separated by a dash '-' or colon ':'. For example, 12:34:ef:cd StreamIdPrefix Optional string Specifies what prefix is used for Stream IDs. Note: An empty string means no prefix will be added to the Stream IDs. Specifying 'null' or omitting this parameter will result in the ComponentID followed by a dot character being used to prefix the Stream IDs. DefaultStreamIdPattern Optional string Specifies the default Stream ID pattern to use. Possible parameters: {DeviceIPAddress}, {DeviceId}, {ObjectType}, {ObjectId}, and {PropertyIdentifier}. An empty or 'null' value will result in '{DeviceId}.{ObjectType}{ObjectId}.{PropertyIdentifier}'. BACnet router data source example The following is an example of valid BACnet data source configuration: { \"IPAddress\": \"192.168.1.1\", \"Port\": 47808, \"MaxConcurrentNetworkRequests\" : 5, \"DeviceRequestDelay\": 10, \"AllowedConsecutiveFailedRequests\": 3, \"DeviceReconnectInterval\": 120 } BACnet routed device data source example The following is an example of valid BACnet routed device data source configuration: { \"IPAddress\": \"192.168.1.1\", \"Port\": 47808, \"MaxConcurrentNetworkRequests\" : 5, \"DeviceRequestDelay\": 10, \"AllowedConsecutiveFailedRequests\": 3, \"DeviceReconnectInterval\": 120, \"DeviceID\": 1, \"NetworkNumber\": 100, \"MacAddress\": \"12\" } Discovery The BACnet Adapter will be able to discover available BACnet devices and objects defined by the data source configuration. In the case of discovery for a BACnet router, the adapter will send a Who-Is request and wait 30 seconds to receive I-Am responses from available devices. Upon receiving an I-Am response, the adapter will request the Protocol Services Supported and Object List properties from the available devices. In the case of discovering a single device, the adapter will not send a Who-Is request but will immediately move to requesting the properties. A successful discovery will result in populating DeviceConfiguration and optionally DataSelection Configuration . DataSelection will be populated with Selected attribute for all items set to false. DeviceConfiguration is read-only and will provide more information such as segmentation and services that are supported. This will help make informed decisions during data selection. When the adapter starts or a new data source is configured, the adapter checks if DeviceConfiguration is populated. Discovery will be performed only if DeviceConfiguration is empty. DataSelection will be updated by discovery only if it is empty. The adapter log indicates when discovery has completed. Example log [15:17:49 INF] [Bacnet] Discovering BACnet router. [15:18:19 INF] [Bacnet] Found 2 BACnet devices during discovery. [15:18:19 INF] [Bacnet] Discovering BACnet device 1. [15:18:21 INF] [Bacnet] Discovery complete for BACnet device 1. [15:18:21 INF] [Bacnet] Discovering BACnet device 33. [15:18:53 INF] [Bacnet] Discovery complete for BACnet router."

    "keywords": "OSIsoft Adapter for BACnet security configuration The BACnet security standard is concerned with the authentication of client and server applications, the authentication of users and confidentiality of their communication. As the security model relies heavily on Transport Level Security (TLS) to establish a secure communication link with an BACnet server, each client, including the OSIsoft adapter, must have a digital certificate deployed and configured. Certificates uniquely identify client applications and machines on servers, and allow for creation of a secure communication link when trusted on both sides. BACnet adapter generates a self-signed certificate when the first secure connection attempt is made. Each BACnet adapter instance creates a certificate store where its own certificates, as well as those of the server, will be persisted. Configure BACnet adapter security Complete the following procedure to configure BACnet adapter security: In your data source configuration, set UseSecureConnection to true . For more information, see OSIsoft Adapter for BACnet data source configuration . The adapter verifies whether the server certificate is present in the adapter trusted certificates folder and is therefore trusted. In case the certificates were not exchanged before the first attemped connection, the adapter persists the server certificate within the adapter rejected certificates folder and the following warning message about the rejected server certificate will be printed: ~~2019-09-08 11:45:48.093 +01:00~~ [Warning] Rejected Certificate: \"DC=MyServer.MyDomain.int, O=Prosys BACnet, CN=Simulation Manually move the server certificate from the RejectedCertificates\\certs folder to the Trusted\\certs folder using a file explorer or command-line interpreter. Linux example using command-line: mv /usr/share/OSIsoft/Adapters/BACnet/BACnet1/Certificates/RejectedCertificates/certsSimulationServer\\ \\[F9823DCF607063DBCECCF6F8F39FD2584F46AEBB\\].der /usr/share/OSIsoft/Adapters/BACnet/BACnet1/Certificates/Trusted/certs/ Note: Administrator or root privileges are required to perform this operation. Once the certificate is in the adapter trusted certificates folder, the adapter trusts the server and the connection attempt proceeds in making the connection call to the configured server. Add the certificate of the adapter to the server's trust store. The connection succeeds only when the adapter certificate is trusted on the server side. For more details on how to make a client certificate trusted, see your BACnet server documentation. In general, servers work in a similar fashion as the clients, hence you can take a similar approach for making the server certificate trusted on the client side. When certificates are mutually trusted, the connection attempt succeeds and the adapter is connected to the most secure endpoint provided by the server.

PI Web API parses the information and sends it configured PI Systems for the OMF endpoint. The static data is used to create a hierarchy on a PI AF server similar to the following: The dynamic health data is actually time-series data that is stored in PI points on a PI Data Archive and can be seen in the AF hierarchy as PI Point Data Reference attributes.

    "keywords": "OSIsoft Adapter for BACnet overview The OSIsoft Adapter for BACnet (Building Automation and Control Networks) is a data-collection component that transfers time-series data from source devices to OMF endpoints in OSIsoft Cloud Services or PI Servers. BACnet is a communication protocol that is developed and maintained by ASHRAE. The adapter adheres to ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 135-2016 and communicates with any device using BACnet/IP, and devices that conform to other BACnet protocols using a BACnet gateway or router. The adapter is installed with a download kit obtained from the OSIsoft Customer Portal and works on devices running either Windows or Linux operating systems. All functions of the adapter are configured using REST API. The configurations are stored in JSON files. For data ingress, an adapter component must be defined in the system components configuration for each device to which the adapter will connect. Each adapter component is then configured with the connection information for the device and the data to collect. For data egress, configuration is needed to specify destinations for the data, including security for the outgoing connection. Additional configurations are available to egress health and diagnostics data, add buffering configuration to protect against data loss, and record logging information for troubleshooting purposes. Once the adapter is configured and sending data, administration functions are used to manage the adapter or individual ingress components of the adapter. Health and diagnostics functions monitor the status of connected devices, adapter system functions, the number of active data streams, the rate of data ingress, the rate of errors, and the rate of data egress. The EdgeCmd utility is an OSIsoft proprietary command line tool that is used to configure and administer an adapter on both Linux and Windows operating systems. It is installed separately from the adapter. <!-- # OSIsoft Adapter for BACnet ======= - [OSIsoft Adapter for BACnet overview](xref:OSIsoftAdapterforBACnetOverview) - [OSIsoft Adapter for BACnet supported features](xref:OSIsoftAdapterforBACnetSupportedFeatures) - [OSIsoft Adapter for BACnet principles of operation](xref:OSIsoftAdapterforBACnetPrinciplesOfOperation) - [Installation](xref:Installation) - [Install the adapter](xref:InstallTheAdapter) - [Install OSIsoft Adapter for BACnet using Docker](xref:InstallAdapterWIthDockerForBACnet) - [Uninstall the adapter](xref:UninstallTheAdapter) - [Configuration](xref:BACnetConfiguration) - [Configuration tools](xref:ConfigurationTools) - [System components configuration](xref:SystemComponentsConfiguration) - [OSIsoft Adapter for BACnet data source configuration](xref:OSIsoftAdapterforBACnetDataSourceConfiguration) - [OSIsoft Adapter for BACnet data selection configuration](xref:OSIsoftAdapterforBACnetDataSelectionConfiguration) - [OSIsoft Adapter for BACnet security configuration](xref:OSIsoftAdapterforBACnetSecurityConfiguration) - [Egress endpoints configuration](xref:EgressEndpointsConfiguration) - [Health endpoint configuration](xref:HealthEndpointConfiguration) - [Diagnostics configuration](xref:DiagnosticsConfiguration) - [Buffering configuration](xref:BufferingConfiguration) - [Logging configuration](xref:LoggingConfiguration) - [System and adapter configuration](xref:SystemAndAdapterConfiguration) - [Administration](xref:Administration) - [Start and stop an adapter](xref:StartAndStopAnAdapter) - [Start and stop ingress component](xref:StartAndStopIngressComponent) - [Retrieve product version information](xref:RetrieveProductVersionInformation) - [Delete an adapter component](xref:DeleteAnAdapterComponent) - [Health and diagnostics](xref:HealthAndDiagnosticsForBACnet) - [Adapter health](xref:AdapterHealthForBACnet) - [Device status](xref:DeviceStatusForBACnet) - [Next health message expected](xref:NextHealthMessageExpectedForBACnet) - [Adapter diagnostics](xref:AdapterDiagnostics) - [System](xref:System) - [Stream count](xref:StreamCount) - [IO rate](xref:IORate) - [Error rate](xref:ErrorRate) - [Egress diagnostics](xref:EgressDiagnostics) -->"

Type the following in the command line (sudo may be necessary): docker run -d --network host bacnetadapter Port 5590 is accessible from the host and you can make REST calls to BACnet Adapter from applications on the local host computer. In this example, all data stored by the BACnet Adapter is stored in the container itself. When the container is deleted, the data stored is also deleted. Persistent storage on the local file system from Docker Complete the following to run the container: Open a terminal window. Type the following in the command line (sudo may be necessary): docker run -d --network host -v /bacnet:/usr/share/OSIsoft/ bacnetadapter Port 5590 is accessible from the host and you can make REST calls to BACnet Adapter from applications on the local host computer. In this example, all data that would be written to the container is instead written to the host directory. In this example the host directory is a directory on the local machine, /bacnet. You can specify any directory. Port number change To use a different port other than 5590 you can specify a portnum variable on the docker run command line. For example, in order to start up the adapter using port 6000 instead of 5590 you would use the command line: docker run -d -e portnum=6000 --network host bacnetadapter Then instead of accessing the REST API using port 5590 you would use port 6000. The following curl command would return the configuration for the container. curl http://localhost:6000/api/v1/configuration Limiting local host access to Docker If you remove the --network host option from the docker run command, no REST access is possible from outside the container. This may be of value where you want to host an application in the same container as BACnet Adapter, and do not want to have external REST access enabled."

Messages with a severity below the level set are not included. The log levels in their increasing order of severity are as follows: Trace, Debug, Information, Warning, Error, Critical, None. For detailed information about the logLevels, see LogLevel . logFileSizeLimitBytes Optional integer The maximum size (in bytes) of log files that the service will create for the component. It must be a positive integer. logFileCountLimit Optional integer The maximum number of log files that the service will create for the component. It must be a positive integer. LogLevel Level Description Trace Logs that contain the most detailed messages. These messages may contain sensitive application data like actual received values, which is why these messages should not be enabled in production environment. Debug Logs that can be used to troubleshoot data flow issues by recording metrics and detailed flow related information. Information Logs that track the general flow of the application. Any non-repetitive general information like the following can be useful for diagnosing potential application errors: - Version information relating to the software at startup - External services being used - Data source connection string - Number of measurements - Egress URL - Change of state “Starting”, “Stopping” - Configuration Warning Logs that highlight an abnormal or unexpected event in the application flow, but does not otherwise cause the application execution to stop. Warning messages can indicate an unconfigured data source state, that a communication with backup failover instance has been lost, an insecure communication channel in use, or any other event that could require attention, but that does not impact data flow. Error Logs that highlight when the current flow of execution is stopped due to a failure. These should indicate a failure in the current activity, not an application-wide failure. It can indicate an invalid configuration, unavailable external endpoint, internal flow error, and so on. Critical Logs that describe an unrecoverable application or system crash, or a catastrophic failure that requires immediate attention. This can indicate application wide failures like beta timeout expired, unable to start self-hosted endpoint, unable to access vital resource (for example, Data Protection key file), and so on. None Logging is disabled for the given component. Example Default logging configuration By default, logging captures Information, Warning, Error, and Critical messages in the message logs.

While the files are accessible to view, OSIsoft recommends that you use REST or the EdgeCmd utility for any changes you make to the files. As part of making adapters as secure as possible, any passwords or secrets that you configure are stored in encrypted form, where cryptographic key material is stored separately in a secure location. If you edit the files directly, the adapter may not work as expected. Note: You can edit any single component or facet of the system individually using REST, but you can also configure the system as a whole with a single REST call. Configure system components The configuration of system components includes adding, updating and deleting components. Add a system component Complete the following procedure to add a new component to the system: Using any text editor, create a file that contains the component to be added to the system in JSON form. For content structure, see Examples . For a table of all available parameters, see System components parameters . Note: The OmfEgress component is required for this initial release for adapters to run. You can add additional components, but only a single OmfEgress component is supported. The following example adds a Modbus TCP adapter. { \"ComponentId\": \"Modbus1\", \"ComponentType\": \"Modbus\" } Note: A unique ComponentId is necessary for each component in the system.

Example #2: See the Hello window. Example #3: See the Hello window. Adapter configuration In order for the BACnet adapter to start data collection, you need to configure the adapter by defining the following: Data source: Provide the data source from which the adapter should collect data. Data selection: Perform selection of BACnet items to which the adapter should subscribe for data. Logging: Set up the logging attributes to manage the adapter logging behavior. For more information, see OSIsoft Adapter for BACnet data source configuration and OSIsoft Adapter for BACnet data selection configuration . Connection The BACnet adapter uses the binary bacnet.tcp protocol to communicate with the BACnet servers. When a secured connection is enabled, the X.509-type client and server certificates are exchanged and verified and the connection between the BACnet adapter and the configured BACnet server is established. Stream creation The BACnet adapter creates types upon receiving the value update for a stream. One stream is created for every selected BACnet item in the data selection configuration. Data collection The BACnet adapter collects time-series data from selected BACnet dynamic variables through BACnet subscriptions (unsolicited reads). The adapter supports the Data Access (DA) part of BACnet specification. Streams by BACnet adapter The BACnet adapter creates a stream with two properties per selected BACnet item. The properties are described in the following table: Property name Data type Description Timestamp DateTime Timestamp of the given BACnet item value update. Value Based on type of incoming BACnet value Value of the given BACnet item update. Stream ID is a unique identifier for each stream created by the adapter for a given BACnet item. If the Custom Stream ID is specified for the BACnet item in data selection configuration, the BACnet adapter uses that as a stream ID for the stream. Otherwise, the adapter constructs the stream ID using the following format constructed from the BACnet item node ID: <Adapter Component ID>.<Namespace>.<Identifier> Note: The naming convention is affected by StreamPrefix and ApplyPrefixToStreamID settings in data source configuration.

Object Types The following BACnet object types are supported: Accumulator AnalogInput AnalogOutput AnalogValue BinaryInput BinaryOutput BinaryValue MultistateInput MultistateOutput MultistateValue Export operation The adapter is able to export available BACnet dynamic variables by browsing the BACnet hierarchies or sub-hierarchies. Export operation actions To limit browsing, specify a comma-separated collection of nodeIds in data source configuration (RootNodeIds). Note: They are treated as roots from where the adapter starts the browse operation. The adapter triggers an export operation after a successful connection to the BACnet server when the data selection file does not exist in configuration directory. Copy the exported data selection JSON file from the directory or retrieve it using a REST API call. Optional: To avoid a potentially long and expensive browse operation, create the data selection file manually. Configure it before you configure the data source or push both in one configuration call together."

    "keywords": "Click to see the code. python print(\"hello world!\") System and adapter configuration The System and adapter components can be configured together using a single call for replacing the existing configuration. Change system and adapter configuration Change the system and adapter configuration by importing the JSON file using a REST client: Using any text editor, create a file that contains the System and adapter configuration in JSON form. For content structure, see Example . Save the file, for example as SystemAdapter.config.json . Use any of the Configuration Tools capable of making HTTP requests and execute a PUT command with the contents of that file to the following endpoint: http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration Note: 5590 is the default port number. If you selected a different port number, replace it with that value. Example using curl (run this file from the same directory where the file is located): curl -d \"@SystemAdapter.config.json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X PUT \"http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration\" Note: In order for some of the adapter specific configurations to take effect, you have to restart the adapter. If the operation fails due to errors in the configuration, the count of the error and suitable error message(s) are returned in the result. Examples Sample configuration file The following sample file shows the configuration of an OPC UA adapter. { \"OpcUa1\": { \"Logging\": { \"logLevel\": \"Information\", \"logFileSizeLimitBytes\": 34636833, \"logFileCountLimit\": 31 }, \"DataSource\": { \"EndpointUrl\": \"opc.tcp://OPCUAServerEndpoint/OPCUA/Server\", \"UseSecureConnection\": false, \"StreamPrefix\": \"OPC_Prefix_\", \"UserName\": null, \"Password\": null, \"RootNodeIds\": null, \"IncomingTimestamp\": \"Source\", \"applyPrefixToStreamId\": true }, \"DataSelection\": [ { \"Selected\": true, \"Name\": \"Sawtooth\", \"NodeId\": \"ns=3;s=Sawtooth\", \"StreamId\": \"SawtoothStream\" } ] }, \"System\": { \"Logging\": { \"logLevel\": \"Information\", \"logFileSizeLimitBytes\": 34636833, \"logFileCountLimit\": 31 }, \"HealthEndpoints\": [ ], \"Diagnostics\": { \"enableDiagnostics\": true }, \"Components\": [ { \"componentId\": \"Egress\", \"componentType\": \"OmfEgress\" }, { \"componentId\": \"OpcUa1\", \"componentType\": \"OpcUa\" } ], \"Buffering\": { \"BufferLocation\": \"C:/ProgramData/OSIsoft/Adapters/OpcUa/OpcUa/Buffers\", \"MaxBufferSizeMB\": -1, \"EnableBuffering\": true } }, \"OmfEgress\": { \"Logging\": { \"logLevel\": \"Information\", \"logFileSizeLimitBytes\": 34636833, \"logFileCountLimit\": 31 }, \"DataEndpoints\": [ { \"id\": \"WebAPI EndPoint\", \"endpoint\": \"https://PIWEBAPIServer/piwebapi/omf\", \"userName\": \"USERNAME\", \"password\": \"PASSWORD\" }, { \"id\": \"OCS Endpoint\", \"endpoint\": \"https://OCSEndpoint/omf\", \"clientId\": \"CLIENTID\", \"clientSecret\": \"CLIENTSECRET\" } ] } }"

OPC UA is recognized as one of the key communication and data modeling technologies of Industry 4.0, due to the fact that it works with many software platforms, and is completely scalable and flexible. The OPC UA adapter transfers time-series data from OPC UA devices to an endpoint on a device. You can add a single OPC UA adapter during installation. For more information, see Installation . As with other adapters, the OPC UA adapter is configured with data source and data selection JSON files. The data source configurations are identical with other adapters, but OPC UA supports an option to generate a data selection file template that you can manually edit and use for subsequent configuration. For details, see OSIsoft Adapter for BACnet data selection configuration . Once you create a template file, you can reuse it on both Linux and Windows without changes."
